     - MapProfessionalClaimAsync()
     - MapInstitutionalClaimAsync()
     - MapClaimStatusAsync()
     - All segment extraction helper methods
   - Need tests for MapperFunction trigger
   - Mock dependencies: IX12Parser, BlobStorageService
   - **Target**: 80%+ code coverage

2. **Integration Tests** (0% complete) - 2 hours estimated
   - End-to-end 837P → ClaimSubmittedEvent JSON
   - End-to-end 837I → ClaimSubmittedEvent JSON
   - End-to-end 277 → ClaimStatusChangedEvent JSON
   - Service Bus emulator testing
   - Dead-letter queue scenarios
   - Blob output structure validation

### ❌ Deployment (Not Started)

3. **Local Testing** (0% complete) - 2 hours estimated
   - Configure local.settings.json with Service Bus connection
   - Create sample X12 files (837P, 837I, 277)
   - Test end-to-end flow with real X12 data
   - Verify event JSON output format

4. **Azure Deployment** (0% complete) - 2 hours estimated
   - Deploy to Azure Dev environment
   - Configure App Settings and Key Vault references
   - Upload sample X12 files to blob storage
   - Trigger via InboundRouter and verify output
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify Application Insights telemetry

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Update Project Tracking**
   - ✅ Task list document updated (Section 3.2)
   - ✅ Overall completion percentages updated
   - ✅ Detailed completion checklist added

2. **Next Steps for ClaimsMapper**
   - Create unit test project: `ClaimsMapper.Function.Tests`
   - Implement comprehensive test coverage
   - Deploy to Azure Dev environment
   - Run smoke tests with real data

3. **Communication**
   - Notify team of corrected status
   - Update project roadmap/Gantt chart
   - Celebrate the progress already made!

### Lessons Learned

1. **Code Review Cadence**: The implementation progressed significantly without updating the task list
2. **Status Validation**: Periodically verify "empty stub" assessments with actual builds
3. **Documentation Drift**: Keep implementation summaries in sync with actual code
