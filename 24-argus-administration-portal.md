# Argus Administration Portal

## Overview

The Argus Administration Portal is a modern web-based application that enables administrators to configure, monitor, and manage EDI transactions and workflows within the Argus healthcare EDI platform. Built with cutting-edge technologies and user experience best practices, the portal provides a comprehensive interface for system administration, real-time monitoring, and operational analytics.

### Repository Structure

The Argus Administration Portal is organized as two separate Git repositories, both configured as submodules under the main `edi-platform` workspace:

### Security Implementation

#### Authentication Flow
1. User navigates to portal
2. Redirect to Azure AD B2C login page
3. User authenticates with credentials (+ MFA if enabled)
4. Azure AD returns JWT token
5. Frontend stores token in memory (not localStorage for security)
6. Token included in Authorization header for all API calls
7. Backend validates token with Azure AD

#### Authorization Levels
- **Administrator**: Full system access
- **Operator**: Transaction management and monitoring
- **Analyst**: Read-only access to reports and dashboards
- **Partner Admin**: Limited to specific trading partner management

#### API Security
- HTTPS only (TLS 1.3)
- JWT token validation on every request
- Role-based authorization attributes
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting per user/API key

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Application Insights Integration
- Request/response logging
- Exception tracking
- Custom event tracking
- Performance metrics
- User session tracking
- Dependency tracking (SQL, HTTP, Service Bus)

#### Logging Strategy
- **Structured Logging**: Using Serilog or NLog
- **Log Levels**: Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical
- **Log Sinks**: Application Insights, Azure Storage, Console
- **Correlation IDs**: For distributed tracing
- **PII Filtering**: Sensitive data redaction

#### Health Checks
- `/health` endpoint for basic health check
- `/health/ready` for readiness probe
- `/health/live` for liveness probe
- Dependency health checks (database, Service Bus, external APIs)

### Risk Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Real-time performance degradation with many concurrent users
  - **Mitigation**: Load testing early (Sprint 7), implement caching, use Azure SignalR Service
  
- **Risk**: Complex workflow designer may exceed timeline
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simplified UI (Sprint 6), enhance in Phase 2

- **Risk**: Third-party integration delays
  - **Mitigation**: Use mock services early, parallel development paths

#### Schedule Risks
- **Risk**: Authentication integration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Deferred to Phase 6, detailed Azure AD planning in advance
  
- **Risk**: Scope creep from stakeholders
  - **Mitigation**: Strict change control process, backlog prioritization
