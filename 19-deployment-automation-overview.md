## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the EDI Platform deployment architecture, strategies, and operational procedures. It serves as the foundational reference for all deployment activities across the platform.

### 1.2 Deployment Philosophy

The EDI Platform follows **DevOps/Platform Engineering principles** where a single unified team owns the entire lifecycle:

- **Build:** Develop features and infrastructure code
- **Test:** Automated and manual testing at all stages
- **Deploy:** Continuous deployment with safety controls
- **Operate:** Monitor, maintain, and respond to incidents
- **Improve:** Continuous optimization based on metrics

### 1.3 Key Principles

| Principle | Description | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Automation First** | Minimize manual intervention | GitHub Actions workflows for all deployments |
| **Infrastructure as Code** | All infrastructure defined in code | Azure Bicep templates versioned in Git |
| **Security by Design** | Security integrated at every stage | Automated scanning, OIDC auth, least privilege |
| **Fail Fast** | Detect issues early in pipeline | PR validation, what-if analysis, smoke tests |
| **Observability** | Full visibility into system state | Azure Monitor, App Insights, deployment logs |
| **Compliance First** | HIPAA requirements embedded | Audit logging, change control, security scanning |

### 1.4 Deployment Scope

The deployment automation covers:

- **Infrastructure:** Azure resources via Bicep (Storage, Service Bus, Key Vault, etc.)
- **Compute:** Azure Functions (7 function apps across 3 environments)
- **Data Pipelines:** Azure Data Factory pipelines
- **Configuration:** Partner configurations, routing rules, mapper configs
- **Monitoring:** Log Analytics, Application Insights, dashboards

```

### 2.2 Repository Strategy

**Multi-Repository Approach** (See [ADR-012: Multi-Repository Strategy](./17-architecture-decisions.md#14-adr-012-multi-repository-strategy))

The platform uses **separate repositories** for each major component, enabling:
- Independent deployment lifecycles
- Granular access control
- Focused CI/CD pipelines
- Clear team ownership

| Repository | Purpose | Deployment Target | Technology | Deployment Frequency |
|------------|---------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|
| **edi-platform-core** | Shared libraries, core functions | NuGet + Function Apps | C# .NET 9 | Weekly patches |
| **edi-sftp-connector** | SFTP integration connector | Function Apps | C# .NET 9 | Weekly |
| **edi-mappers** | Transaction mappers (834, 837, 270/271, 835) | Function Apps | C# .NET 9 | Bi-weekly |
| **edi-connectors** | Partner integration connectors | Function Apps | C# .NET 9 | As needed |
| **edi-partner-configs** | Partner configurations, routing rules | Blob Storage | JSON/YAML | Multiple daily |
| **edi-database-controlnumbers** | Control number database | Azure SQL | SQL DACPAC | Monthly migrations |
| **edi-database-eventstore** | Event store database | Azure SQL | EF Core migrations | Monthly migrations |
| **edi-database-sftptracking** | SFTP tracking database | Azure SQL | EF Core | Monthly migrations |
| **edi-documentation** | Platform documentation | GitHub Pages | Markdown | As needed |

**Workspace Orchestration:**

- **edi-platform** repository serves as the orchestrator with setup scripts
- VS Code workspace file (`.code-workspace`) provides unified development experience
- PowerShell scripts automate multi-repo operations (clone, branch, status checks)

### 2.3 Deployment Components

## 3. Environment Strategy

### 3.1 Environment Overview

| Environment | Azure Subscription | Purpose | Data Classification | Deployment Frequency |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Dev** | EDI-DEV | Feature development and testing | Synthetic test data | Multiple times daily |
| **Test** | EDI-DEV | Integration and regression testing | Anonymized production data | Daily |
| **Prod** | EDI-PROD | Live production workloads | PHI (HIPAA-regulated) | Weekly (scheduled) |

### 3.2 Environment Characteristics

- **Retention:** Logs retained 7 years (HIPAA compliance)

### 3.3 Environment Parity

**Goal:** 95%+ parity between test and production

| Component | Dev | Test | Prod |
|-----------|-----|------|------|
| Azure Resources | Core only | Full stack | Full stack |
| Resource SKUs | Basic | Standard | Premium |
| Replication | Single region | Single region | Multi-region |
| Backup | None | Daily | Hourly + geo-redundant |

## 4. Deployment Models

### 4.1 Infrastructure Deployment (In-Place Updates)

**Use Case:** Infrastructure changes (Bicep templates)

**Process:**
1. **Validation:** What-if analysis shows planned changes
2. **Deployment:** Apply Bicep templates to existing resources
3. **Verification:** Run post-deployment validation scripts
4. **Rollback:** Redeploy previous template version if issues detected

**Advantages:**
- In-place updates minimize downtime
- Resource state preserved where possible
- Fast rollback via redeployment

**Disadvantages:**
- Some changes require resource recreation
- Brief downtime for stateful resources

### 4.2 Function App Deployment (Rolling)

**Use Case:** Application code updates

**Process:**
1. **Build:** Compile C# code, run tests, create zip package
2. **Deploy:** Upload package to Azure Functions
3. **Monitor:** Watch for errors in first 10 minutes
4. **Rollback:** Redeploy previous version if issues detected

**Advantages:**
- Minimal downtime for function apps
- Fast rollback via redeployment
- Automated health checks

**Disadvantages:**
- Brief restart during deployment
- Limited to function apps (not infrastructure)

### 4.3 ADF Pipeline Deployment (Canary)

**Use Case:** Data pipeline updates

**Process:**
1. **Export:** Generate ARM templates from ADF UI
2. **Deploy:** Apply ARM templates to target ADF instance
3. **Test:** Run pipeline with test trigger (single file)
4. **Monitor:** Watch for errors in test run
5. **Promote:** Enable scheduled triggers after validation
6. **Rollback:** Disable triggers and redeploy previous version

**Advantages:**
- Test pipeline with production data (controlled)
- Gradual rollout reduces risk
- Easy to disable/enable triggers

**Disadvantages:**
- Manual test trigger required
- Rollback requires full redeployment

### 4.4 Configuration Deployment (Atomic)

**Use Case:** Partner configs, routing rules

**Process:**
1. **Validate:** JSON schema validation in CI
2. **Upload:** Upload new config to blob storage with version suffix
3. **Switch:** Update app settings to point to new config version
4. **Monitor:** Watch for config load errors
5. **Rollback:** Update app settings to previous version

**Advantages:**
- Instant rollback (change pointer)
- No downtime (configs reloaded automatically)
- Old versions retained for audit

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires versioned config design
- Potential for cache inconsistencies

## 5. Release Management

### 5.1 Release Cadence

| Release Type | Frequency | Window | Approval Required |
|--------------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Hotfix** | As needed | Any time | 1 reviewer + incident ticket |
| **Patch** | Weekly | Thursday 10 PM - 12 AM ET | 1 reviewer |
| **Minor** | Bi-weekly | Thursday 10 PM - 2 AM ET | 2 reviewers |
| **Major** | Quarterly | Saturday 2 AM - 8 AM ET | 2 reviewers + change board |

### 5.2 Release Workflow

    Review->>CD: Approve
    CD->>Env: Deploy to Prod
    Env->>CD: Smoke Tests
    CD->>Dev: Notify Success
```

### 5.3 Versioning Strategy

**Semantic Versioning:** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 2.5.3)

- **MAJOR:** Breaking changes (API contracts, database schema changes)
- **MINOR:** New features, backward-compatible changes
- **PATCH:** Bug fixes, security patches

**Version Sources:**
- **Git Tags:** `v2.5.3` tags on main branch
- **Assembly Version:** C# projects use `<Version>2.5.3</Version>`
- **Deployment Labels:** Azure resources tagged with `version=2.5.3`

**Branching Strategy:**
- **main:** Production-ready code
- **feature/*:** Feature development
- **hotfix/*:** Emergency production fixes
- **release/*:** Release preparation (optional)

### 5.4 Change Control

**Production deployments require:**

1. **Change Ticket:** Documentation with:
   - Change description and rationale
   - Risk assessment (Low/Medium/High)
   - Rollback plan
   - Testing evidence
   - Stakeholder approvals

2. **Deployment Plan:**
   - Pre-deployment checklist
   - Step-by-step deployment procedure
   - Post-deployment validation
   - Monitoring plan

3. **Communication:**
   - Notify stakeholders 48 hours in advance
   - Schedule deployment window
   - Send deployment start notification
   - Send deployment completion notification
