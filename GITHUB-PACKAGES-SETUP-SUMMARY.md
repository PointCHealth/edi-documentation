## Benefits of GitHub Packages

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Automatic Authentication** | No manual secrets management - uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| **Organization-Scoped** | All repos in PointCHealth org can access packages |
| **Versioned Dependencies** | Track exactly which library version each function uses |
| **Independent Builds** | Each repo builds without needing others checked out |
| **CI/CD Caching** | NuGet packages cached, 5-10 minute build time savings |
| **Free for Private Repos** | No additional cost within organization |
| **Integrated Updates** | Dependabot automates dependency updates with testing |

---

## Migration Path

### From Local Project References to NuGet Packages

**Before:**
```xml
<ProjectReference Include="..\edi-platform-core\shared\EDI.Configuration\EDI.Configuration.csproj" />
```

**After:**
```xml
<PackageReference Include="EDI.Configuration" Version="1.0.*" />
```

### Workflow Changes

**Before (fails in CI):**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Restore
    run: dotnet restore  # Fails - edi-platform-core not cloned
```

**After (works everywhere):**
```yaml
permissions:
  packages: read  # Required
steps:
  - name: Restore
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Auto-auth
    run: dotnet restore  # Success!
```

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All 6 shared libraries publish to GitHub Packages automatically
- ✅ All 4 consumer repositories restore packages from GitHub Packages
- ✅ CI/CD builds succeed without local project references
- ✅ Local development works with PAT setup
- ✅ Dependabot monitors for updates
- ✅ Documentation complete for developers

---

## Timeline Impact

**Added to Phase 1 (Week 1-2):**
- GitHub Packages setup: 16 hours
- This is **blocking work** - must be completed before other repos can build independently

**Total Effort Updated:**
- Previous: 523 hours (13.1 weeks)
- New: **553 hours (13.8 weeks)**
- Difference: +30 hours (+0.7 weeks)

**Why the increase?**
- GitHub Packages setup adds 16 hours
- Cross-repository configuration adds complexity
- One-time investment that unblocks all future work
