## üåç Environment Strategy

| Environment | Purpose | Deployment Trigger | Approval Required | Data |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|------|
| **Dev** | Development testing | Automatic on merge to `main` | No | Synthetic |
| **Test** | Integration testing | Manual after dev validation | 1 reviewer | Anonymized production copy |
| **Prod** | Production workloads | Manual with change control | 2 reviewers + 5min wait | Live production data (PHI) |
