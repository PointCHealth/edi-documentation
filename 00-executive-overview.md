## Platform Purpose

The Healthcare EDI Platform is a **HIPAA-aligned, event-driven Azure solution** that enables secure, scalable, and compliant exchange of healthcare electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions between trading partners.

### What It Does

The platform processes X12 EDI files through a complete lifecycle:

```text
External Partners → Ingestion → Validation → Routing → Processing → Acknowledgment → Delivery
```

### Transaction Types Supported

|-------------|------|---------|------------------|
| **837** | Claims | Healthcare claims submission | Payers, Clearinghouses |
| **834** | Enrollment | Member enrollment and maintenance | Health Plans, Employers |
| **270/271** | Eligibility | Real-time eligibility inquiries and responses | Providers, Payers |
| **835** | Remittance | Payment and remittance advice | Payers, Providers |
| **276/277** | Status | Claim status inquiries and responses | Providers, Payers |
| **278** | Auth | Prior authorization requests | Providers, Payers |
| **999/TA1** | Acks | Technical acknowledgments | All Partners |

## Architectural Principles

### Core Principles

1. **Zero Trust / Least Privilege** – RBAC & ACL minimization, just-in-time elevation
2. **Separation of Concerns** – Ingestion vs. enrichment vs. analytics tiers
3. **Idempotent & Replayable** – Ability to reprocess from immutable raw store
4. **Event-Driven First** – Prefer storage and message events for partner-driven flows, complemented by governed scheduling for proactive workloads
5. **Declarative Infrastructure** – Everything versioned & reproducible via IaC
6. **Secure by Default** – Encryption, private endpoints, restricted egress
7. **Observability First** – Unified telemetry, lineage, and SLA tracking
8. **Metadata-Centric** – All processing actions stamped & queryable

### Trading Partner Routing Pattern

After a file is validated and the immutable raw copy is persisted, a lightweight routing function parses only the envelope headers needed to emit one routing message per ST transaction. These messages are published to a Service Bus Topic (e.g., `edi-routing`) with filterable application properties (`transactionSet`, `partnerCode`, `priority`, `direction`).

**All trading partners** (both external partners and internal systems like eligibility, claims, enrollment management, remittance) are configured with integration endpoints and adapters. Each trading partner:

- Has a unique partner code and configuration profile
- Connects via configured endpoints (SFTP, REST API, database, message queue)
- May send data to the platform (inbound), receive data from the platform (outbound), or both (bidirectional)
- Receives data through partner-specific integration adapters that handle format transformation and protocol adaptation

This unified pattern:

1. Treats all data sources and destinations consistently as trading partners
2. Prevents tight coupling between ingestion/outbound throughput and partner system responsiveness
3. Enables independent scaling and retry semantics per partner via Service Bus DLQs
4. Provides a normalized, minimal metadata contract (no PHI) for routing
5. Allows each trading partner to implement their own architectural patterns without impacting the platform

**Next Milestone**: Core platform ingestion operational

### AI-Driven Development Strategy

**AI Agent Workflow**:

1. **Structured Requirements Intake**: Agents ingest machine-readable specifications from the shared backlog and derive prompt scaffolding automatically
2. **Autonomous Generation**: GitHub agents produce code, tests, infrastructure templates, and documentation within isolated workspaces
3. **Self-Validation Loop**: Agents execute linting, security scans, data-quality checks, and integration suites; failing signals trigger autonomous regeneration
4. **Policy Enforcement**: Compliance agents apply policy-as-code gates (HIPAA, PHI masking, cost controls) before promotion
5. **Automated Deployment**: Release agents promote artifacts through environments once validations pass, capturing full telemetry for traceability

**Key Implementation Principles**:

1. **Autonomous Development**: GitHub agents generate and maintain 90%+ of application and infrastructure assets
2. **Continuous Iteration**: Agents ship validated increments daily through automated pipelines
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: 100% of provisioning flows through agent-authored Bicep
4. **Self-Tested Delivery**: Agents author and execute unit, integration, and compliance tests
5. **Secure by Default**: Zero-trust patterns enforced by agents running continuous security scans
6. **Operational Telemetry**: Agents maintain monitoring, runbooks, and documentation as living artifacts
