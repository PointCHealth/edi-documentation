## Reconciliation Strategy

### Claim-Level Reconciliation

1. Match `ClaimPayment.ClaimNumber` to `Claim.ClaimNumber`
2. Populate `ClaimPayment.ClaimID` foreign key
3. Compare amounts:
   - `ClaimPayment.ChargeAmount` vs `Claim.TotalChargeAmount`
   - `ClaimPayment.PaymentAmount` vs `Claim.TotalPaidAmount`
4. Set `IsReconciled = true` if match
5. Set `HasDiscrepancy = true` and populate `DiscrepancyNotes` if mismatch

### Service Line Reconciliation

1. Match `ServiceLinePayment.ProcedureCode` + `ServiceDateFrom` to `ClaimServiceLine`
2. Populate `ServiceLinePayment.ClaimServiceLineID` foreign key
3. Calculate variance:
   - `PaymentVariance = ExpectedPaymentAmount - PaymentAmount`
4. Set reconciliation flags

### Payment Status Workflow

```
Received (Initial)
    ↓
Reconciled (All claims matched)
    ↓
Posted (Applied to accounting)
```

If reconciliation fails:
```
Received → HasDiscrepancy = true → Manual review required
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Strategy

**Query Patterns Optimized**:
1. Find payments by remittance ID (unique index)
2. Find claim payments by claim number (reconciliation)
3. Find unreconciled payments (composite status index)
4. Find payments by date range (clustered by received date)
5. Find adjustments by code (reporting/analysis)
6. Find patient responsibility adjustments (filtered index)

**Index Types Used**:
- Unique indexes: 4 (GUIDs, natural keys)
- Composite indexes: 12 (multi-column queries)
- Filtered indexes: 6 (nullable FK columns)
- Event sequence indexes: 4 (event sourcing queries)

### Cascade Delete Rules

**Cascade DELETE**:
- Payment → ClaimPayment → ServiceLinePayment → PaymentAdjustment
- Deleting a Payment removes entire payment tree

**Restrict DELETE**:
- ClaimPayment → Claim (prevent orphaning reconciled data)
- ServiceLinePayment → ClaimServiceLine (preserve link)
- Payment → TransactionBatch (preserve audit trail)

---

## Event Sourcing Integration

All entities include event sourcing metadata:
- `Version` (int) - Optimistic concurrency
- `LastEventSequence` (long) - Last event applied
- `LastEventTimestamp` (datetime2(3)) - Event time
- `IsActive` (bool) - Soft delete flag

Event replay capability:
1. Query events by EventSequence
2. Apply to projection entities
3. Rebuild state from events

---

## Next Steps (Remaining Tasks)

### Task 5: PaymentProjectionBuilder Function 🔲
**Estimated Effort**: 16 hours

Create Azure Function to consume `RemittanceAdviceReceivedEvent` and build projections:

1. Subscribe to Service Bus topic `edi-events` with filter:
   ```sql
   EventType = 'RemittanceAdviceReceived'
   ```

2. Deserialize `RemittanceAdviceReceivedEvent`

3. Build Payment projection:
   - Create `Payment` entity from event
   - Create `ClaimPayment` entities (loop through event.ClaimPayments)
   - Create `ServiceLinePayment` entities (nested loop)
   - Create `PaymentAdjustment` entities (claim and service level)

4. Reconciliation logic:
   - Query `Claim` table by `ClaimNumber`
   - Match `ClaimServiceLine` by procedure code and date
   - Set foreign keys and reconciliation flags

5. Transaction handling:
   - Use EF Core transaction for atomic writes
   - Idempotency check (prevent duplicate processing)

6. Error handling:
   - Retry logic for transient failures
   - Dead-letter for permanent failures
   - Application Insights logging

**Files to Create**:
- `edi-platform-core/functions/PaymentProjectionBuilder.Function/`
  - Program.cs
  - PaymentProjectionFunction.cs
  - Services/IPaymentProjectionService.cs
  - Services/PaymentProjectionService.cs
  - Services/ReconciliationService.cs
  - PaymentProjectionBuilder.Function.csproj
  - host.json
  - local.settings.json

### Task 6: Unit Tests 🔲
**Estimated Effort**: 12 hours

Create test project: `RemittanceMapper.Tests`

**Test Coverage**:
- RemittanceMappingService segment extraction methods
- MapperFunction message processing
- Error handling and retry logic
- Event serialization/deserialization
- Edge cases (missing segments, malformed data)

### Task 7: Integration Tests & Deployment 🔲
**Estimated Effort**: 16 hours

**Integration Tests**:
- Sample 835 files (various scenarios)
- End-to-end Service Bus processing
- Blob storage verification
- Database projection verification
- Reconciliation accuracy

**Deployment**:
- Deploy to Azure dev environment
- Validate with real 835 transactions
- Monitor Application Insights
- Performance testing
